# Palo Alto - Secure The Future Competition

### Welcome to my repository documenting my journey and learnings during the Secure the Future Competition organized by Palo Alto. This competition is not just a challenge; it's an opportunity for me to enhance my cybersecurity skills, tackle real-world problems, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of digital security.

### As student candidates, we were tasked with extensive research and development, creating a comprehensive competition report, and a compelling presentation. 📊🎥
